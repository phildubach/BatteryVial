## Printing
* The part has been designed with rather thin walls in some places (0.9mm). It
  helps to set the extrusion width to 0.45mm (usually the default on Slic3r).
* The body may look nicer when selecting to print 3 perimeters. Otherwise, the
  fill pattern can be visible on the outside. That's even more important with
  shrinking material like ABS.  For ABS, I found that I had to print at least 2
  parts at once for best results, otherwise there was insufficient cooling
  time, resulting in the wall shrinking irregularly and the tube becoming oval.
  This disappears entirely when printing 2 tubes at once.
* There is a radial gap of 0.1mm between the inner and outer threads. This
  works beautifully on the Prusa i3. The threads fit nicely on the first try,
  without there being too much of a gap. Let me know if you experience problems
  with the threads on your printer.
